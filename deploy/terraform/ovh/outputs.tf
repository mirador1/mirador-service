# Terraform outputs — OVH module for mirador
#
# What gets exported (and why callers need each):
#   - cluster_id      → for `bin/cluster/ovh-up.sh` / `ovh-down.sh` to
#                       reference the cluster in subsequent OVH API calls
#                       (e.g. fetching the kubeconfig, scaling the node
#                       pool manually).
#   - cluster_name    → for kubectl context naming (avoids hardcoding).
#   - cluster_url     → control plane endpoint, also embedded in the
#                       generated kubeconfig.
#   - region          → echoes back the deployed region so the caller
#                       can confirm what landed (esp. useful in CI logs).
#   - kubeconfig      → SENSITIVE — the full kubeconfig YAML for kubectl.
#                       Mark sensitive so it doesn't print in plan / apply
#                       output by default. Use `terraform output -raw
#                       kubeconfig > ~/.kube/ovh-mirador.yaml` to write it.
#   - private_network_id → for stage-2 use cases that attach more
#                          resources (DBs, additional clusters) to the
#                          same vRack subnet.

# Role        : Full kubeconfig YAML — drop into ~/.kube/ovh-mirador.yaml
#               and switch context with `kubectl config use-context
#               kubernetes-admin@mirador-prod` (the user/context name OVH
#               assigns).
# Why         : Mark sensitive=true so this doesn't render in plain text
#               on the apply output (terraform redacts sensitive outputs).
#               Use `terraform output -raw kubeconfig` to read it without
#               the surrounding "<sensitive>" guard for one-off writes
#               to disk.
# Gotchas     : - The kubeconfig contains a client certificate + key with
#                 the cluster-admin role. Treat it as you would a root
#                 password: never commit, restrict file perms (600).
#               - The cert expires after 1 year. OVH auto-rotates it on
#                 the cluster side; re-run `terraform apply` to refresh
#                 the local copy before expiry.
# Related     : bin/cluster/ovh-up.sh writes this to ~/.kube/ovh-mirador.yaml.

# Role        : Diagnostic block — exposes the running cost estimate based
#               on the configured node count and flavor. Reads as plain
#               text in `terraform output running_cost`.
# Why         : Catches budget surprises BEFORE applying. A reviewer
#               glancing at the plan output sees "running_cost: ~€50/month"
#               and can intervene if max_nodes was bumped past the cap.
# Gotchas     : - The estimate is for steady-state max-scaling. If
#                 desired_nodes < max_nodes (typical) the actual cost is
#                 lower until autoscale kicks in.
#               - OVH B2-7 baseline price is hardcoded here at €25.20.
#                 Update if OVH changes its pricing (rare; check the SKU
#                 page yearly).
