# ADR-0016: External Secrets Operator + Google Secret Manager

- **Status**: Accepted — **cut over 2026-04-18**
- **Date**: 2026-04-18

## Context

Secrets used by the backend (`mirador-secrets`, `keycloak-secrets`) are
currently created by a `kubectl create secret generic` step inside the
`deploy:gke` CI job. This works but has three problems:

1. **The secret values live in GitLab CI variables**. Rotating a
   password means editing CI → triggering a manual job → verifying.
   No audit trail on who read the secret or when.
2. **The secrets exist in two places** — GitLab CI and the cluster —
   and they can drift silently (a secret rotated on GCP but not
   re-injected via CI would look valid until the next deploy).
3. **No cross-cluster story**. If we replicate the demo on EKS/AKS/k3s
   tomorrow, every cluster needs the same secrets reproduced from the
   same source of truth — which today is nowhere central.

Google Secret Manager (GSM) is the GCP-native secret vault. Combined
with the External Secrets Operator (ESO), a cluster-resident Kubernetes
secret becomes a projection of a GSM entry, refreshed on a cron.

## Decision

**External Secrets Operator watches `SecretStore` + `ExternalSecret`
CRDs and materialises K8s Secrets from Google Secret Manager via
Workload Identity Federation** (no service-account JSON key on the
cluster — same pattern as ADR-0007).

Concretely:
- ESO is installed via the upstream Helm chart in the
  `external-secrets` namespace, with tight resource requests
  (ADR-0014).
- One `SecretStore` (namespace-scoped) per namespace that consumes
  secrets: `app`, `infra`. Both point at the same GSM project via WIF.
- One `ExternalSecret` CR per logical secret (`mirador-secrets`,
  `keycloak-secrets`), mapping GSM entries → K8s Secret keys. Refresh
  interval: 1 h.
- The scaffolding is ready under
  [`deploy/external-secrets/`](../../deploy/external-secrets/) but is
  kept out of `base/` until the GSM entries are actually created by
  the user (the k8s-dry-run CI hook would otherwise fail on
  unresolvable references).

## Alternatives considered

**HashiCorp Vault**:
- More feature-complete (dynamic secrets, PKI, ACLs).
- **Against**: too much platform component for a demo. Vault is a
  whole second cluster-resident service to run + back up + upgrade.
  The demo's secret set is tiny (5 keys) and static.

**Sealed Secrets** (bitnami):
- Encrypt secrets in git; only the cluster controller can decrypt.
- **Against**: the secrets are still in git (just encrypted), so
  key rotation requires a git rewrite. ESO's "git references a
  secret-manager entry by name" model is cleaner.

**GKE Secret Manager CSI driver**:
- Mounts GSM entries as files in pods, no K8s Secret intermediary.
- **Against**: most Spring Boot apps want `@Value` from env vars, not
  files. Would require a projected-volume-to-env shim. ESO keeps the
  standard env-from-secret pattern the code already uses.

## Consequences

Positive:
- Single source of truth for secrets: GSM. Rotation = `gcloud secrets
  versions add` (no CI change, no cluster change). ESO picks it up
  within the refresh interval.
- Same pattern on any cloud: swap the `SecretStore` backend
  (GCPSMBackend → AWSSecretsManagerBackend → AzureKeyVaultBackend)
  and the rest is identical.
- CI loses its `kubectl create secret` step — one less privilege for
  the CI token to carry.
- Audit trail: GSM tracks access via Cloud Audit Logs.

Negative:
- New CRDs (`SecretStore`, `ExternalSecret`) that Argo CD now manages.
- A short window where a GSM write hasn't propagated to the cluster
  yet. The 1 h refresh is fine for password rotation, tight for an
  incident requiring immediate credential rotation — there's a manual
  `kubectl annotate externalsecret` hook for forced refresh.

## Cut-over log (2026-04-18)

Executed during the GKE bring-up session. Decision: the demo goes
all-in on the "industry-standard" pattern because (a) GSM is free for
up to 6 active secret versions + 10k accesses/month (8 secrets × 24
accesses/day ≈ 5800 ops/month — well under the free tier), and
(b) documenting the cutover via this ADR + README is itself part of
what the demo showcases.

Concrete steps applied:

1. `gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com iamcredentials.googleapis.com`
2. Created 8 GSM entries: `mirador-db-password`, `mirador-jwt-secret`,
   `mirador-api-key`, `mirador-gitlab-api-token`, `mirador-otel-auth`,
   `mirador-keycloak-admin`, `mirador-keycloak-admin-password`,
   `mirador-keycloak-kc-db-password`.
3. Created GCP service account
   `external-secrets-operator@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with
   `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on each entry.
4. Bound the K8s SA `external-secrets/external-secrets` to the GCP SA via
   Workload Identity (`roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser`) and annotated
   the K8s SA with `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=...`.
5. Committed `deploy/kubernetes/base/external-secrets/` (SecretStore ×
   2 namespaces + 2 ExternalSecret CRs + a README) and wired it into
   `base/kustomization.yaml`.
6. Argo CD reconciled the CRDs within ~3 min; ESO projected the GSM
   entries into K8s Secrets with the same names as the hand-created ones
   (`mirador-secrets` in `app` + `infra`, `keycloak-secrets` in `infra`).
7. Verified via
   `kubectl get secret mirador-secrets -n app -o jsonpath='{.data.DB_PASSWORD}' | base64 -d`.

Cost: ~€0.10/month (2 secrets over the 6-free tier × $0.06, with the
access operations well under the 10k free quota).

## Reactivation path (for future you)

1. Create the GSM entries:
   ```
   gcloud secrets create mirador-db-password --replication-policy=automatic
   echo -n "$NEW_PASSWORD" | gcloud secrets versions add mirador-db-password --data-file=-
   ```
2. Grant the cluster's WIF-backed service account `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`.
3. Move `deploy/external-secrets/*` into `deploy/kubernetes/base/external-secrets/`.
4. Add it to `base/kustomization.yaml` so Argo CD picks it up.
5. Delete the `kubectl create secret generic mirador-secrets` step
   from `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
